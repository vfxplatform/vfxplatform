  <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
    The production of visual effects and animation for film requires the use of a number of different software products. In order for these products to work together and share data through commonly understood file formats, they frequently depend on the same set of third-party components. Unfortunately software vendors are often not building with the same versions of these shared components. The result can be significant integration challenges for studios and end users.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
    For example, if the versions of <a href="http://python.org" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">Python</a> vary then plug-ins written for one software product will not work with another. The same issue can arise with <a href="http://qt.io" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">Qt</a> widgets or <a href="https://www.boost.org/" class="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">Boost</a> libraries. Even varying versions of low-level components like the C++ compiler or glibc can result in plug-in incompatibilities or crashes when sharing files.

    <h2>Goals</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
    Our main focus is on minimising incompatibilities between different software packages:
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 space-y-2">
    <li>Ease the support burden for integrated pipelines at VFX and animation studios.</li>
    <li>Make it easier for software vendors to support their products on Linux and other operating systems.</li>
    <li>Encourage further adoption of Linux by making it less daunting for small to medium studios and end users.</li>
    <li>Help the industry adopt new technologies more rapidly.</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>Process</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
    Each year a new VFX Reference Platform is published for use by vendors building software for release during that calendar year. Each year the process is as follows:
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 space-y-2 mb-6">
    <li><strong>January to April</strong> - Research and information gathering.</li>
    <li><strong>May</strong> - Draft Reference Platform published. The community is invited to provide feedback on the Draft.</li>
    <li><strong>Late July / August</strong> - Draft discussed at our annual Birds of a Feather meeting at SIGGRAPH and User Group meeting.</li>
    <li><strong>September 1st</strong> - Final version of the Reference Platform published.</li>
    <li><strong>November</strong> - Late changes occasionally permitted if required to pick up late releases from upstream dependencies, and where there is consensus within the community.</li>
  </ul>
