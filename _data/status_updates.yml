      CY2026 is now Final and will be effective from January 1st. All package versions called out by the platform are now released. In 2021, the Imath library was split off from the OpenEXR 3 release into its own separately released package. Since Imath types are part of the OpenEXR API/ABI (as well other libraries such as Alembic), the OpenEXR / Imath maintainers have requested that the VFX Platform call out a specific, compatible version of Imath to avoid ambiguity.
